I don't project Prescott to have that poor of a fantasy day this week, but it won't be easy. Since Week 7, Philly has fielded an elite pass defense, allowing the 11th-fewest yards per attempt, the third-lowest passer rating, the second-fewest passing touchdowns, and the tenth-lowest CPOE.

That was the second-highest passing yardage performance of the season for Nix and only the second time he had 8.0 or more yards per attempt in a game. Jones should have a strong game in Week 12.

Love could have a nice game this week, as he has been strong against the blitz, and we know Brian Flores loves to blitz heavily weekly.

Last week, Carolina was 14th in pass rate over expectation, which was only the second game this season where they finished with a positive value in that department (first time since Week 2). Last week was only the second time this season that Young has surpassed 7.0 yards per attempt and 200 passing yards in a game. Among 43 qualifying quarterbacks, Young ranks 31st in yards per attempt, 28th in passing yards per game, 38th in highly accurate throw rate, and 29th in catchable target rate. I worry that this could be a one-off outlier performance for Young, but he has another nice matchup this week against a struggling 49ers' pass defense. We'll see if he can build off last week's monster game. Since Week 7, San Francisco has allowed the 12th-highest yards per attempt, the most passing yards per game, the fourth-most passing touchdowns, and the fourth-highest CPOE.",

I don't think it'll be that bad, but I don't project a ceiling game for Brown in Week 12. In Week 1, Dallas utilized two high with 57.6% of their defensive snaps, which I expect them to have a similar defensive game plan in Week 12. Against two high, Brown has seen his target per route run rate drop to 21% (third on the team) with 1.33 yards per route run (fourth on the team). Since Week 7, Dallas has still had issues stopping perimeter wide receivers, allowing the second-most receiving yards and the tenth-most PPR points per target.

There's more volatility with how the Colts will attack the Chiefs this week after what we saw from them last week than I anticipated. In Weeks 5-10, Kansas City had the ninth-highest single high rate (56%). Last week, they flipped the script and returned to their classic bread and butter as a two-high heavy defense (58.5%). The variations in their coverage structure mean massively different things for their receiving options. If they roll out single-high, I would expect Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren to lead the passing attack. If they continue with more two high this week, Indy will look to feature Josh Downs and Michael Pittman more. Against single high, Pittman is fourth in target per route run rate (20%) on the team with 1.45 yards per route run (fourth). Against two high, Pittman is second on the team with a 24% target per route run rate and leads the squad with 2.32 yards per route run.

Taylor will have his hands full this week with what could be an improving Baltimore pass defense. Yes, I have some skepticism surrounding their stats since Week 7. In Weeks 7-11, they faced Caleb Williams, J.J. McCarthy, Tua Tagovailoa, and a combination of Dillon Gabriel and Shadeur Sanders. Their pass defense could be for real, but they likely won't be heavily tested this week, considering the state of the Jets' passing attack. Since Week 7, Baltimore has allowed the third-lowest success rate per dropback, the sixth-fewest yards per attempt, and the second-lowest CPOE.

Walker got his first touchdown since Week 3 in the process. Let's have a real conversation, though. It still wasn't great. Walker still only had one red zone rushing attempt, while George Holani (two) and Zach Charbonnet (three) had more work inside the 20-yard line. Walker remains a volatile player. It's not because of talent, but related to his usage still. Since Week 9, he has taken over more of the backfield, though, averaging 15.7 touches and 80.7 total yards with a 48.4% snap rate, a 39% route share, and a 7.5% target share. Since Week 9, he has had more red zone carries (eight) than Charbonnet (seven). Among 54 qualifying backs, Walker ranks fifth in explosive run rate and missed tackle rate. This week's matchup might not be as great as it seems at first glance. Since Week 7, Tennessee has allowed the eighth-most rushing yards per game, the ninth-highest explosive run rate, and the seventh-most yards before contact per attempt. If we zoom in further, it isn't amazing, though. I know it's a small sample, but I have to bring it up. Since Week 9, with Jeffery Simmons (returned in Week 11) and T'Vondre Sweat (returned in Week 7) back, Tennessee has allowed the 11th-fewest rushing yards per game, the third-lowest explosive run rate, zero missed tackles, and the tenth-fewest yards after contact per attempt. We'll see if Tennessee's run defense is as improved as I fear this week. If not, Walker should chew them up. If they have truly gotten better, it could be a disappointing showing.",

In Weeks 5-10, Kansas City had the ninth-highest single high rate (56%). Last week, they flipped the script and returned to their classic bread and butter as a two-high heavy defense (58.5%). The variations in their coverage structure mean massively different things for their receiving options. If they roll out single-high, I would expect Pierce and Tyler Warren to lead the passing attack. If they continue with more two high this week, Indy will look to feature Josh Downs and Michael Pittman more. Against single high, Pierce leads the team with a whopping 29% target per route run rate and 3.44 yards per route run. Against two high, he's fourth on the team with a 13% target per route run rate and 1.38 yards per route run. That's as wide a divide as you can get for a player's outlook. Pierce is a boom or bust option this week. The Chiefs' outside corners have been giving, which helps his cause this week.

Watson's downfield role could help him immensely this week against a secondary that has allowed the highest deep ball completion rate and the 12th-most deep passing yards per game. Also, Minnesota has the highest two high rate in the NFL (68.5%). Against two high, since Week 8, Watson has ranked fifth in target per route run rate (13%) on the team but second in yards per route run (1.73). Watson could have another monster game if he hits on the downfield looks.

This week is a wonderful opportunity and a matchup setup for Pearsall to bounce back. Since Week 8, Carolina has utilized single high at the 11th-highest rate (56%). This matters immensely because Pearsall's coverage splits have been massive. Against single high, he leads the team with a 23.6% target share, 3.87 yards per route run, and a 31.9% first-read share. Since Week 7, Carolina has allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points per game and the 11th-fewest receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers, so the matchup won't be easy for Pearsall this week, but I think he can overcome it.",

Gardner played nine snaps in the slot in his first game with Indy, but that wasn't on Drake London, who he followed on 72.4% of his routes. My projection for how Indy defends the Chiefs is to revert back to their two-high structure that they utilized in Weeks 7-9 (53.5-65.6%). That would guard against Patrick Mahomes' deep ball and effectively limit Xavier Worthy in the process. That would then leave Kenny Moore to deal with Rashee Rice when he is in the slot. Looking at the game unfolding this way would be detrimental to Worthy. If Indy moves back to two high, it'll negatively impact Worthy, as he has only a 15% target per route run rate and 0.64 yards per route run against two high. Since Week 7, Indy has allowed the tenth-fewest receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers. Sit Worthy this week. I expect Rashee Rice and Travis Kelce to lead the way for the Chiefs this week.",

Since Week 7, Tennessee has allowed the eighth-most rushing yards per game, the ninth-highest explosive run rate, and the seventh-most yards before contact per attempt. If we zoom in further, it isn't amazing, though. I know it's a small sample, but I have to bring it up. Since Week 9, with Jeffery Simmons (returned in Week 11) and T'Vondre Sweat (returned in Week 7) back, Tennessee has allowed the 11th-fewest rushing yards per game, the third-lowest explosive run rate, zero missed tackles, and the tenth-fewest yards after contact per attempt. We'll see if Tennessee's run defense is as improved as I fear this week. If not, Charbonnet should have a solid game. If they have truly gotten better, it could be a disappointing showing.",

If the Cards are getting trucked, he is likely on the bench. Last week, Knight finished with nine touches and 45 total yards. Knight has only a 9% missed tackle rate and 1.70 yards after contact per attempt this season. Jacksonville has kept early down rushers in check.

In Weeks 5-10, Kansas City had the ninth-highest single high rate (56%). Last week, they flipped the script and returned to their classic bread and butter as a two-high heavy defense (58.5%). The variations in their coverage structure mean massively different things for their receiving options. If they roll out single-high, I would expect Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren to lead the passing attack. If they continue with more two high this week, Indy will look to feature Josh Downs and Michael Pittman more. Against single high, Downs is third on the team with a 21% target per route run rate with 1.52 yards per route run. Against two high, Downs leads the team with a 26% target per route run rate and is third in yards per route run with 1.66. The Chiefs have kept slot receivers in check since Week 7, so that obviously doesn't help Downs even if the Chiefs do utilize more two-high this week.

Jacoby Brissett's truckload of passing attempts helped to prop up Dortch. Dortch had only a 10.5% target share and 14.3% first-read share. Unless you expect Brissett to throw the football another 57 times this week, you shouldn't be flexing Dortch. It's also a horrible matchup for Dortch. Since Week 7, Jacksonville has allowed the third-fewest PPR points per target to slot receivers (Dortch 82.5% slot rate last week).",

Since Week 10, he has averaged only ten touches and 32.5 total yards while seeing three red zone rushing attempts (Swift, five) and a 38% snap rate. Among 54 qualifying backs, Monangai ranks 21st in explosive run rate and 16th in yards after contact per attempt. If he doesn't score this week, you'll likely be sad that you played him. This week, he faces an average Steelers' run defense that, since Week 7, has ranked 16th in explosive run rate, 17th in yards before contact per attempt, and 16th in rushing success rate.",

He'll likely work as the passing-down back this week. His workload will probably have a lot to do with the game situation. If the Cardinals are trailing and pass-heavy, Carter will be on the field a ton. If it's a neutral script or if the Cards are playing with a lead, then Carter could see his snaps drop. Carter finished last week with seven touches and 28 total yards. Carter had a 12.3% target share (seven targets) and 22 receiving yards. The Jaguars have allowed the eighth-most receiving yards per game and the seventh-highest yards per reception to backs. Carter is a viable PPR flex.",

Mitchell dropped three of his six targets. You don't have to be a math whizz to know that isn't great. I have zero interest in flexing him this week against a secondary that, since Week 7, has allowed the seventh-fewest PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.",
