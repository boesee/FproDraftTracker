Williams' fantasy production has been much better than his real-life quarterback play. Rushing production and some nice matchups have helped him this season.

Fields has still offered plenty of production weekly, with his legs averaging 7.6 rushing attempts and 47 rushing yards with three scores on the ground. Among 41 qualifying passers, he ranks 28th in yards per attempt, 20th in highly accurate throw rate, and 25th in catchable target rate. With Garrett Wilson out this week, Fields will need to rely upon his legs to get the job done in fantasy, which is easily possible. Carolina ranks 15th in yards per attempt and 19th in success rate per dropback while giving up the tenth-most passing touchdowns and ranking dead last in pressure rate. Fields should enjoy some clean pockets this week, which hasn't been the case this season as he's faced the second-highest pressure rate.",

Detroit isn't a great matchup, but White should flirt with 15-20 touches with outstanding touchdown equity to possibly outkick the tough defensive matchup.

Among 50 qualifying backs, Hall ranks first in explosive run rate and ninth in missed tackles forced per attempt. The problem for Hall this week is that the Carolina run defense doesn't look like the pushover matchup that it had been for much of the last season plus. Since Week 3, they have allowed the third-fewest rushing yards per game, the eighth-lowest missed tackle rate, and the 12th-fewest yards after contact per attempt.

Maybe he flashes a fantasy pulse this week against Miami, but Cleveland also could just choose to keep the ball on the ground and lean on their rushing attack. Miami has allowed the fourth-highest yards per attempt, the highest success rate per dropback, and the second-highest passer rating. The Dolphins are also fifth in blitz rate and 12th in pressure rate, but I'm not worried about their pass rush with the aim to get the ball out of Gabriel's hands quickly, as he has the second-lowest time to throw.",

He has three red zone targets across those two games. Diggs is likely to see shadow coverage this week from L'Jarius Sneed. Sneed followed Nico Collins, Davante Adams, and Marvin Harrison Jr. on 75-85.2% of their routes. Adams roasted him, but that was in Week 2. In Weeks 4-5 against Collins and Harrison Jr., Sneed held each player below 40 receiving yards (zero touchdowns) in his coverage. Since Week 3, Tennessee has had the second-highest two-high rate in the NFL (66.9%). Since Week 4, against two high, Diggs has had a 29.4% target share with 2.24 yards per route run and a 37.5% first-read share. Don't be surprised if Drake Maye feeds Diggs this week despite the shadow coverage from Sneed, but I'll say, with the way that Maye has been spreading the ball around, I also wouldn't be shocked if he avoids the matchup. There's a wide range of outcomes for Diggs in Week 7.",

In those three games, he's had three deep targets and three red zone targets. Last year, in their two meetings with Las Vegas, the Raiders utilized single high with 53.8-57.1% of their defensive snaps. This season, in four of six games, they have utilized single high with 56.1-69.6% of their defense snaps, so I think the Chiefs will see mostly single high coverage this week. Against single high, since Week 4, Worthy has had a 21.4% target share, 3.13 yards per route run, and a 25% first-read share.

Metcalf, Courtland Sutton, and Mike Evans on at least 65.2% of their routes this season. Pickens and Evans secured touchdowns against Gardner, but none of those receivers surpassed 57 receiving yards in Gardner's coverage. McMillan has a 22.4% target share with a 42.3% air-yard share while averaging 63.3 receiving yards per game (1.91 yards per route run) with a 28.5% first-read share.

Kamara has retained his passing game usage with a 56.5% route share and a 19% target share. During that span, Kamara still owns all the red zone work with five carries inside the 20-yard line. Kamara is still performing decently on a per-carry basis, ranking 20th in missed tackle rate and 29th in explosive run rate. He should post a solid stat line this week against a run defense that has surrendered the second-most rushing yards per game, the fourth-highest explosive run rate, and the second-highest missed tackle rate. Kamara is due for some touchdown regression as he hasn't scored since Week 1. This could be the week.",

It's incredibly frustrating, considering his talent, that the Colts are resistant to playing him in a full-time capacity. Overall, he has a 59.1% route share, an 18% target share, 36.2 receiving yards per game (1.85 yards per route run), and a 21.1% first-read share. This week, Downs faces a secondary that, in four of six games, has utilized single high with 51.1-59.4% of their defensive snaps. Against single high, Downs has seen his numbers slightly increase with an 18.8% target share, 2.15 yards per route run, and a 21.4% first-read share. Downs is flex-worthy this week, but I wouldn't expect a repeat of Week 6. The Chargers have allowed the ninth-fewest PPR points per target and the 12th-fewest fantasy points per game (tied) to slot receivers. Downs is now in the concussion protocol. He didn't practice on Wednesday. I'll update his outlook on Friday, but he may miss this week's game.",

The Rams have the eighth-highest single high rate in the NFL (57%). Against single high, Hunter has only a 19% target per route run rate and 0.65 yards per route run. This week's matchup doesn't set up well for Hunter. The coverage matchup isn't in his favor, and the Rams have been tough against slot receivers. Yes, the Rams have allowed the 13th-most receiving yards per game and the eighth-most fantasy points per game to slot receivers, but they have faced the most slot targets in the NFL.

Chubb finished with 11 touches and 61 total yards while splitting the red zone carries with Marks. Chubbs's per-touch metrics are still bad, with a 10% missed tackle rate and only 2.07 yards after contact per attempt. I don't expect him to find much running room this week. Chubb is a touchdown-dependent flex this week. Seattle has allowed the second-fewest rushing yards per game and the lowest explosive run rate and yards after contact per attempt. Sit Chubb this week.",

Spears has been effective in limited action with a 22% missed tackle rate and 2.78 yards after contact per attempt. The rushing matchup for Spears is brutal, but that's not really where he'll make his money this week if you toss him in as a flex in PPR formats. The Patriots have given up the fourth-fewest rushing yards per game, the sixth-lowest explosive run rate, and the eighth-lowest yards after contact per attempt. To receiving backs, they have allowed the tenth-most receiving yards and yards per reception. Spears is a deeper flex option in PPR leagues.",

He hasn't gotten any of the red zone work during that stretch, with Kamara getting all those opportunities. Since Week 5, Miller has 50% of the running back carry share with only a 21.2% route share and 3.4% target share. If he's going to pay off as a flex option, this is a good week/matchup to do so. He ranks first in missed tackles forced per attempt and 32nd in yards after contact per attempt. The Bears' run defense has been a problem for their team. They have given up the second-most rushing yards per game, the fourth-highest explosive run rate, and the second-highest missed tackle rate. Miller could house a run this week and pay off as a flex option.",
