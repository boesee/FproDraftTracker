    "note": "Over the last two games, Herbert has had a sizable decline from the version that we have seen the rest of the season. It's understandable, but unfortunate. He has finished as the QB17 and QB27 in weekly scoring. That QB17 finish was also massively influenced by his 66 rushing yards, which we saw last week, and isn't sustainable (in Week 15, he had zero rushing yards). Since Week 14, among 35 qualifying quarterbacks, Herbert has ranked 25th in passing yards per game, 25th in yards per attempt, 29th in catchable target rate, and 29th in fantasy points per dropback. Dallas's horrible pass defense could help to elevate Herbert back to QB1 status this week, but it's better to view him as a QB2 with upside. Since Week 11, Dallas has allowed the sixth-most passing yards per game, the ninth-most yards per attempt, and the tenth-highest CPOE. During that span, they have also had the ninth-best pressure rate, which could also help to tamp down Herbert's stats if the Chargers' battered offensive line allows the pass rush to get home regularly.",

Since Week 11, Detroit's pass defense has been horrible, giving up the most passing yards per game, the third-highest yards per attempt, the fourth-most passing touchdowns, and the 12th-highest success rate per dropback.

That market share has amounted to only 6.2 targets per game. In that span, he has had only two red zone targets and seven deep targets. Add in a possible shadow from DJ Turner this week, and the uncertainty of Quinn Ewers under center and Waddle becomes a shaky player to start. DJ Turner has followed DK Metcalf (twice), Justin Jefferson, Romeo Doubs, Zay Flowers (twice), and Gabe Davis on 62.9-90.3% of their routes.

None of those wide receivers scored a touchdown or surpassed 60 receiving yards, with Gonzalez following them. Temper your expectations for Flowers this week, as Gonzalez could easily be in his back pocket for 60-70% of his routes. Overall, Flowers is the WR23 in fantasy points per game with a 27.2% target share with 68.5 receiving yards per game, 2.40 yards per route run, and a 33.2% first-read share.

    "note": "Before we get into last week's numbers, I want to say Philip Rivers surprised me. Considering that he hadn't played in the NFL in five years and suited up on short notice, he looked good. Did he look like a 45-year-old quarterback at times, moving around in the pocket? Yep. Would I like him to have more zip on some passes? Yep. Does that mean he can't play point guard for this offense right now? Nope. Last week, Rivers played point effectively with a 4.8 aDOT, a 66.7% highly accurate throw rate, and a 77.8% catchable target rate. Sadly, that amounted to only 120 passing yards, one passing touchdown, 4.4 yards per attempt, and a QB28 finish for fantasy. Rivers is a low-end QB2 again this week, but he should be able to manage the game effectively again. Since Week 11, the 49ers have allowed the 13th-most passing yards per game, the fourth-highest CPOE, and ranked 16th in yards per attempt. It should also help Rivers that during that span, this defense has had the third-lowest pressure rate.",

This week, he faces a Jacksonville pass defense that, since Week 11, has had the sixth-highest two-high rate (57.3%). Since Week 11, against two high, Franklin has had a 10.2% target share, 1.48 yards per route run, and a 13.3% first-read share. The Jags have allowed substantial production to perimeter wide receivers, so that could help Franklin this week. He is still a thin play when looking at the coverage matchup and his recent usage.

He has six red zone rushing attempts during those games versus Aaron Jones' two. Mason is a strong touchdown-dependent flex play this week. If Minnesota builds a strong lead, we could see him creep into the 13-15 carry range (or higher). Since Week 11, the Giants have remained one of the worst run defenses in the NFL, giving up the most rushing yards per game, the second-highest explosive run rate, and the most yards after contact per attempt.",

In those eight games, Hockenson has had only three red zone targets and one deep target. Hockenson is on the streaming radar again this week. Since Week 10, the Giants have faced the fewest tight end targets in the NFL, so it's not surprising that they have allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game to the position. The interesting fact is that, also during that span, they have allowed the second-most yards per target to tight ends. Hockenson could have a surprising game this week and log another low-end TE1 finish.",
