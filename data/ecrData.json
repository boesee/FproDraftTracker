    "note": "Yes, Daniel Jones had a rough Week 9. Does that wipe out everything else he has done this season? Nope. Players have down games. It happens, and we move on. Jones is the QB9 in fantasy points per game. Among 41 qualifying passers, Jones ranks sixth in yards per attempt, tenth in highly accurate throw rate and catchable target rate, and seventh in fantasy points per dropback. He continues to add value on the ground, especially near the goal line with ten rushing yards per game and five rushing scores. Jones should have a bounceback game this week against an Atlanta secondary that since Week 5, has allowed the 13th-highest yards per attempt and success rate per dropback, the 14th-highest passer rating, and the 11th-most passing touchdowns (tied).",

He has a 26.3% target share with 62.2 receiving yards per game, 1.79 yards per route run, and a 30.3% first-read share. Olave could see an even larger market share of targets moving forward with Rashid Shaheed heading to Seattle. Olave has eight red zone targets and 15 deep targets this season. If Tyler Shough can deliver him catchable targets (that's a big if), Olave should have another strong game this week. Since Week 5, Carolina has allowed the 13th-most PPR points per target and the 14th-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers.",

It was against Denver. One of the best pass defenses in the NFL. That isn't to excuse Mills' performance, but it's understandable. This week's matchup is much more giving. It could allow Mills to outperform expectations as a decent streaming option for deeper leagues. Since Week 5, Jacksonville has allowed the seventh-most passing yards per game, the tenth-highest yards per attempt, the second-most passing touchdowns (tied), and the 12th-highest CPOE.

    "note": "Last week, in his first game with J.J. McCarthy under center, Addison had a 16% target share (four targets), a 41.3% air-yard share, and a 26.7% first-read share. He led the team with three deep targets and finished with two receptions and 48 receiving yards. This week, he faces a Baltimore secondary that has the fourth-highest rate of single high (60.3%). Against single high, Addison has seen his target per route run rate dip from 19% (overall) to 15% and his yards per route run fall from 2.04 (overall) to 1.49. It's a great matchup for Addison, so maybe that balances out the coverage concerns I have, but I'm still not expecting a monster game this week. Since Week 5, Baltimore has allowed the eighth-most receiving yards per game and the 14th-most fantasy points per game to perimeter wide receivers.",

Among 62 qualifying backs, he ranks 27th in explosive run rate and 26th in missed tackles forced per attempt.
