He had only 210 passing yards with a 60% completion rate and 6.0 yards per attempt. Over the last two games, with Minnesota's pass defense getting healthier, they have still ranked 16th in yards per attempt and passer rating and given up the 11th-highest CPOE and passing touchdowns (tied). There's a lot of risk and reward with both quarterbacks in this game. Each could be a QB1 this week or a disappointing QB2.",

    "note": "Jared Goff is the QB14 in fantasy points per game with two QB1 outings this season. While it hasn't translated consistently to fantasy success, Goff has had an outstanding season so far. Among 42 qualifying passers, he ranks fifth in yards per attempt, 12th in passing yards per game, seventh in highly accurate throw rate, and second in catchable target rate. Goff will face a Philly pass defense that since Week 6, has held passers to the 13th-lowest yards per attempt, the 14th-lowest passing yards per game, the lowest passing touchdowns, and has ranked 15th in CPOE. It would be a bleak matchup, BUT Philly also has a rusted patch of their armor that Goff can strike and reach the heart of their pass defense. Philly has allowed the seventh-highest yards per attempt, the 11th-most passing yards per game, and the 11th-highest passer rating to play action passing. Overall, Goff has utilized play-action at the sixth-highest rate (30.1%), but last week with Dan Campbell taking over the play call sheet they bumped that up to 51.5%. Play-action could carry Goff to another strong game against a formidable opponent.",

Since Week 9, he has ripped some long runs, ranking sixth in explosive run rate, but he needs to give a hat tip to his offensive line. In that span, he has the highest yards before contact per attempt with an insane 5.61 yards before contact per attempt. In the same sample, he ranks 29th in success rate (50%), 24th in stuff rate (46.4%), 33rd in missed tackle rate (11%), and 41st in yards after contact per attempt (1.61). Henderson has had some massive running lanes and taken advantage with his back-breaking speed. He's primed to do it again this week. Since Week 6, the Jets have allowed the sixth-most rushing yards per game, the ninth-highest explosive run rate, and the fifth-highest missed tackle rate.",

The volume constraints this offense has placed upon him have been capping his weekly upside. Across his last five games, he has surpassed 65 receiving yards only once. The matchup is good for McMillan, but it's fair like I said to question his weekly upside at this point because of the offense that he is stuck in. Atlanta has the highest single high rate in the NFL (71.3%). Against single high, McMillan has seen his target per route run rate increase to 26% with 2.05 yards per route run. It's a marginal increase, so don't hit a backflip out of your seat. Atlanta's issues covering perimeter wide receivers could help him this week, though. Since Week 6, they have allowed the eighth-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.",

Jacksonville has utilized two high with 50-70.8% of their defensive snaps in six of their nine games. They do have three single high heavy games as well, so if they go single high heavy, then Johnston would lead the team in the passing game. It's a risk to fade Johnston this week, but if Jacksonville does lean on two high, he won't be heavily involved. Against two high, Johnston has a 15% target per route run rate (fifth on the team) and only 1.14 yards per route run (fifth on the team). Since Week 6, Jacksonville has allowed the fourth-most PPR points per target and the ninth-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers.

    "note": "RJ Harvey is set to step into an expanded role this week with J.K. Dobbins out. We'll see what that role will be, but I expect him to lead the backfield in touches and contribute on early downs and in the passing game. Harvey has been effective this season with his workload. Among 64 qualifying backs, he ranks 30th in explosive run rate and 21st in missed tackles forced per attempt. Among 61 backs in the passing game, he is third in target per route run rate, eighth in yards per route run, and 11th in first downs per route run. The Chiefs have been vulnerable to backs in the passing game, giving up the 11th-most receiving yards per game and the eighth-highest yards per reception, but they have been a tough rushing matchup. Since Week 6, Kansas City has allowed the second-fewest rushing yards per game, the 11th-lowest explosive run rate, and had the sixth-highest stuff rate. Harvey will need volume and passing game usage to carry him over the finish line as a strong play this week, but that is quite possible.",

Zach Charbonnet finished with the same number of carries, and he and George Holani got into the end zone. Walker tied for the team lead with four red zone rushing attempts and led the way with a 40.7% snap rate, a 30.8% route share, and a 46.2% red zone snap share. In the first half, Walker had a 57.1% snap share while Charbonnet had a 28.6% snap rate inside the 20-yard line. Seattle won't run away with this week's game, so we can cancel out last week's George Holani blip. Based on these numbers, I do think that positive regression is coming for Walker, and it could be this week. Among 64 qualifying backs, Walker ranks seventh in explosive run rate and fifth in missed tackle rate. This week, he faces a Rams run defense that, since Week 6, has allowed the eighth-highest yards after contact per attempt, the ninth-highest success rate, the 11th-highest yards per carry to gap runs, the seventh-highest success rate to gap runs, and has logged the 13th-lowest stuff rate. Walker has been the leader for the team in gap run concepts (44.2%). I'm just as worried about Walker disappointing again this week, but the data is quite positive for him this week. I'll close my eyes and plug him into lineups and trust the process.",

Last week, Xavier Hutchinson had a 51% route share and didn't draw a single target. Christian Kirk and Jaylin Noel logged 44.9% and 32.7% route shares. In Week 10, Higgins had a 49% route share, which isn't great and was fourth on the team, but he had a 15.6% target share, a 22% air-yard share, finishing with a 29% target per route run rate, 42 receiving yards, 1.75 yards per route run, and a 16.7% first-read share. Higgins also had two red zone targets and a deep target. I hate Houston's deployment of their wide receivers so much this season. It makes me furious. Higgins is a risky flex play that could pay off this week. Since Week 6, the Titans have allowed the fifth-most receiving yards per game and the second-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.",

I expect him to lead the way for Washington's ground game this week. In the first half of last week's game, Rodriguez had a 68% snap share and handled six of ten running back rushing attempts while logging a 53.8% route share. Among 64 qualifying backs, Rodgriquez ranks third in yards after contact per attempt. Rodriguez is a strong flex play this week. Since Week 6, Miami has allowed the eighth-highest explosive run rate, the seventh-highest yards after contact per attempt, and ranked 19th in rushing yards per game.",
