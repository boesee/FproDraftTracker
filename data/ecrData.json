All of that matters little this week against the horrendous Dallas pass defense. The Cowboys can't stop anyone through the air, so I doubt they slow down Nix this week. Dallas has allowed the second-most passing yards per game and passing touchdowns, the fifth-highest success rate per dropback, and the highest CPOE.",

Williams has three QB1 weekly finishes this season (QB9, QB1, QB10), but has finished as the QB20 or lower in his three other games (QB20, QB24, QB27). Among 41 qualifying quarterbacks, he ranks 16th in yards per attempt, 35th in adjusted completion rate, 34th in highly accurate throw rate, and he has the third-highest off-target rate. Williams couldn't take advantage of a plus matchup last week against the Saints. Before their bye, the Ravens held Matthew Stafford to 181 passing yards, 6.9 yards per attempt, and 0.6% CPOE. I know it's a one-game sample, but if Baltimore has figured out some of their defensive struggles, Williams is in trouble. At best, he has another plus matchup this week, but as last week showed, I don't know if he can take advantage of a plus matchup at this point.",

    "note": "Jaxson Dart...franchise changer. The aura farming rookie swag machine has been the QB4 in fantasy points per game since Week 4. The last time he faced this defense, he was the QB3 in fantasy for the week. After what we all witnessed last week against Denver (QB3 for the week), no one should be counting him out in any matchup. He has averaged 8.8 rushing attempts and 44.5 rushing yards per game with three scores on the ground. Since Week 4, among 38 qualifying passers, Dart ranks 28th in highly accurate throw rate, 14th in catchable target rate, 20th in hero throw rate, and fifth in fantasy points per dropback. He still has a lot of growth as a passer that needs to occur because during this stretch, he also has the sixth-highest turnover-worthy throw rate. Dart can excel again this week, but it won't be an easy road to travel. Philly has allowed the tenth-fewest yards per attempt and the second-lowest adjusted completion rate while also ranking 17th in success rate per dropback and passing yards per game allowed.",

Wentz faces a Bolts' pass defense that has been more pliable since Week 4, allowing the tenth-most yards per attempt while ranking 18th in CPOE and 16th in success rate per dropback.

Against the blitz, Olave has also seen a 36.8% target share with 4.07 yards per route run and a 40% first-read share. Olave should have a nice Week 8 against a secondary that has allowed the 13th-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers and ranks 15th in fantasy points per game.

Taylor could shred a Bengals' pass defense that has allowed the fifth-highest yards per attempt, the fourth-most passing yards per game, and the second-highest success rate per dropback. Another big factor that could lead to his success is the fact that Cincy has the fifth-lowest pressure rate. It'll come in handy as Taylor operates behind New York's Swiss cheese offensive line, which has allowed the highest pressure rate. Taylor has been listed with a knee injury and is day-to-day.

I never thought this type of season would come for Warren after wanting and hoping the Steelers would turn over the keys to the backfield to Warren. I was so heavily invested in him in previous seasons, only to watch Mike Tomlin run Najee Harris out there, that I gave up hope and invested heavily in Kaleb Johnson this season. I'm so happy that Warren is in the driver's seat for Pittsburgh this season. He's a talented player and deserves it. Among 57 qualifying backs, he ranks second in missed tackles forced per attempt and seventh in yards after contact per attempt. Warren will have to overcome a horrible matchup this week with volume. Green Bay has allowed the second-fewest rushing yards per game, the lowest explosive run rate, the ninth-lowest missed tackle rate, and the third-lowest yards after contact per attempt.",

Since Week 4, with Jaxson Dart under center, Robinson has been the WR34 in fantasy points per game with a 24.2% target share, 55.8 receiving yards per game (1.69 yards per route run), and a 25% first-read share. He has four red zone targets across his last four games. The Eagles have been tough against slot receivers this season, allowing the sixth-fewest fantasy points per game and eighth-fewest receiving yards per game to the position, but Robinson overcame the tough matchup in their last meeting. I won't rule out that he can do it again this week as a decent flex option.",

Last week, Dowdle played 46.5% of the snaps overall, finishing with 18 touches and 96 total yards as the RB21 for the week. Dowdle has been awesome this season on a per-touch basis.

Johnston has only two games this season where he has had less than a 19.1% target share, and they happen to be last week and Week 5 when he sustained the hamstring injury. He isn't on the injury report this week, so I hope he's back to full health. Overall, Johnston is the WR9 in fantasy points per game, commanding a 19% target share with 67.8 receiving yards per game (1.72 yards per route run) and a 23.1% first-read share. He has seven red zone targets and ten deep targets this season. He's third on the team in red zone targets and leads the squad in deep targets. This week, he faces a Minnesota pass defense that has the highest two-high rate in the NFL (70.3%). Against two high, Johnston has seen his usage decline with a 15.3% target share, 1.06 yards per route run, and a 20.3% first-read share. With the health concerns and the coverage matchup this week. I'll be below consensus with Johnston. Minnesota has been bleeding out production to perimeter wide receivers, so even with limited volume, Johnston could pay off this week, but I'm skeptical. Minnesota has allowed the highest PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.",

Shaheed could have a nice week this week if he's able to capitalize on the Bucs' single high coverage. This week, he'll face a Tampa Bay secondary that has utilized single high with 51.1-61.8% of their defensive snaps in four of their seven games this season. Against single high, Shaheed has seen his target share increase to 22.2% with 1.56 yards per route run and a 23% first-read share. The problem that could even things out is that the Bucs also have the fourth-highest blitz rate, and against the blitz, Shaheed's target share has dipped to 15.8% with 0.98 yards per route run and a 17.8% first-read share. Spencer Rattler has leaned on Chris Olave heavily against both single high and the blitz. This adds some more volatility to Shaheed's Week 8 projection. Shaheed could easily be a solid flex play this week, just be aware of the downside risk that he carries as well. Tampa Bay has allowed the 13th-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers and ranks 15th in fantasy points per game.",

    "note": "Kayshon Boutte is the WR36 in fantasy points per game, but he's been a volatile flex play this season. He has three weeks as a top-24 wide receiver (WR17, WR4, WR24), but he also has four games this season where he finished outside the top 50 wide receivers in scoring. Boutte has an 11.8% target share (17.2 aDOT) with 2.03 yards per route run and a 14% first-read share. He leads the team with eight deep targets while only seeing one red zone target. This week, he faces a Cleveland pass defense that has the third-highest rate of single high (61.2%). Against single high, Boutte has seen his target share increase to 15.5% with 2.30 yards per route run and a 15.5% first-read share. Boutte's downfield role might not hit this week, though, against a Cleveland secondary that ranks 18th in deep completion rate and has limited offenses to the fourth-fewest deep passing yards per game. Boutte is a dice roll flex play that offers a nice ceiling, but he has an equally low floor. The Browns have allowed the tenth-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.",

As a receiving option, he has a 7.3% target share, a 51% target per route run rate, 3.49 yards per route run, and 0.143 first downs per route run. Last week, in the first half, Smith played 26.2% of the snaps with a 27.6% route share and a 16.7% target share (four targets). Smith is a viable flex this week in PPR formats.

The Chargers have been a soft run defense to exploit all year, allowing the third-highest explosive run rate, the sixth-highest missed tackle rate, and the fifth-highest yards before contact per attempt.
