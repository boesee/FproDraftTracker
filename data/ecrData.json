Goff has a tough matchup incoming this week, so we'll see if he's up to the task. Detroit will need to put up points to hang with the Rams, so we'll see if Goff (I think he is) is up to the task. Since Week 10, the Rams have allowed the fourth-lowest CPOE, the 14th-lowest yards per attempt, and ranked 15th in passer rating. Goff will see pressure in his face this week, which could also be problematic. Since Week 10, the Rams have had the 11th-best time to pressure.",

I didn't see that rushing volume coming. I did, however, see the Chargers skewing run-heavy as Herbert passed only 26 times, completing 46.2% of his passes with 139 yards and 5.3 yards per attempt. Herbert did have a 10.2 aDOT but only managed to sport a 57.7% catchable target rate. The Chargers' passing attack should be downgraded for at least this week again. Since Week 10, Kansas City has allowed the ninth-most passing yards per game, the 11th-most yards per attempt, and the 13th-highest passer rating. I don't think the Chargers will ramp up the volume through the air this week, but hopefully Herbert can see better efficiency numbers when he does chuck it.",

Cleveland is a nightmare fuel matchup for Williams. Since Week 10, Cleveland has allowed the third-fewest passing yards per game, the fifth-fewest yards per attempt, and the lowest success rate per dropback.

Yes, the volume and trailing game scripts have helped, but let's just bask in this for fantasy purposes. Since Week 6, among 37 qualifying passers, Brissett ranks first in dropbacks and passing yards per game, fourth in passing touchdowns, 18th in highly accurate throw rate, and 22nd in catchable target rate as the QB3 in fantasy points per game. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and this could be the week where Brissett falls outside of the top 12 in weekly scoring. Houston's pass defense has been demonic. Since Week 10, they have allowed the ninth-lowest success rate per dropback, the tenth-fewest passing yards per game, the ninth-lowest yards per attempt, and the third-lowest passer rating. During the same stretch, they have also ranked second in pressure rate. Good luck, Mr. Brissett.",

I don't want to chase last week's outlier game against a larger sample of the 2025 season. Rodgers is a mid-range QB2 again this week. Since Week 10, Miami has allowed the 15th-lowest yards per attempt and the tenth-lowest passer rating while giving up the 14th-highest CPOE and passing yards per game.",

This week, he has a chance to stack another nice game and prove he should be the Browns' answer at quarterback for 2026.

Henderson split the red zone work with Stevenson evenly as both backs had two red zone rushing attempts. It's a coin flip for volume between the two this week which adds a layer of volatility when projecting Hendrson's Week 15 outlook. I've been encouraged by Henderson's efficiency marks since Week 9, though. Since Week 9, among 51 qualifying backs, Henderson has been 14th in explosive run rate and 24th in missed tackle rate. Those are huge leaps from where he began the season. Henderson should find running room this week against what's still a weak Bills run defense.

The last time Flowers faced the Bengals, DJ Turner followed him on 62.9% of his routes, holding him to two targets and zero receiving yards in his coverage. Turner has shadowed six times this season, following Flowers, DK Metcalf (twice), Justin Jefferson, Romeo Doubs, and Gabe Davis on 62.9-90.3% of their routes, holding each receiver to 45 or fewer scoreless receiving yards. I'm worried about Flowers this week. Even if Turner isn't in his back pocket for most of the game, we also need to talk about the fact that the last time Cincy played Baltimore, they utilized two high with 52.6% of their defensive snaps. Against two high, Flowers has had a 23.1% target share, 1.68 yards per route run, and a 30.5% first-read share. The market share against two high remains high, but the efficiency dip isn't great.

    "note": "Despite his incredible efficiency and his standout performances this season, Dowdle took a back seat to Chuba Hubbard last week with a 43.5% snap rate, a 20.8% route share, and a 10% target share. Dowdle has outplayed Hubbard handily on a per-touch basis. Among 57 qualifying backs, Dowdle ranks 13th in explosive run rate, 17th in missed tackle rate, and sixth in yards after contact per attempt. Last week, Dowdle finished with 20 touches and 79 total yards, seeing a touch or a target on 20 of his 27 snaps played. That type of usage on a per-snap basis is difficult to maintain. You're threading a fine needle, so if Dowdle's snap count doesn't flip back in the other direction, he could become volatile, while on the surface it looked like he got an RB2-level workload in his last game. Dowdle is a strong flex and could be an RB2 this week (RB36 in Week 13). Since Week 10, New Orleans has allowed the tenth-most rushing yards per game, the 13th-most yards before contact per attempt, and the third-highest yards per carry to zone runs (Hubbard 58.6% zone).",

Since Week 7, he has had only two outings that landed him inside the top-36 for wide receiver weekly scoring (WR5, WR32). Since Week 7, he has had a 28.7% target share and a 36.4% first-read share that he has turned into only 48.1 receiving yards per game and 1.42 yards per route run. In those seven games, he has had eight red zone targets and six deep targets. Not all of Egbuka's struggles can be laid at his feet, as during this stretch, only 50% of his targets have been catchable. Much of this has been related to Baker Mayfield's struggles. Hopefully, with the Bucs at full strength in the wide receiver room this week, Egbuka can have a bounce-back game with Mayfield playing better. With the improved target competition, I do expect his market share in the offense to fall. Egbuka falls into the WR2/3 or flex territory this week. Since Week 10, Atlanta has allowed the second-most PPR points per target and the third-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers.",

With that limited route share, Kincaid has to get peppered with targets and hopefully score a touchdown to pay off. He's been a limited snap player all year, but a 50-60% route share is a different conversation from a player living in the 40s. Could he pay off again this week? It's possible. New England has allowed the 11th-most receiving yards per game and the 12th-most fantasy points per game to tight ends. Starting Kincaid this week depends upon your willingness to embrace risk and your options at tight end. I don't think Kincaid's knee and hamstring will be much healthier than they were last week, so he's probably looking at a similar route share range in Week 15.",

He didn't play much on passing downs with only a 10.3% route share, so he could get game-scripted out this week if (or when) the 49ers run away with the game. Pollard finished with 25 carries and 161 rushing yards (two scores). It was his highest carry total of the season and his first 100-yard rushing day in 2025. Among 57 qualifying backs, Pollard ranks 36th in explosive run rate and 26th in yards after contact per attempt. Pollard could have another nice day if the Titans lean on the run. Since Week 10, the 49ers have allowed the third-highest rushing success rate, the eighth-highest missed tackle rate, the eighth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and had the third-lowest stuff rate.",

Brown, Calvin Ridley, Quentin Johnston, Terry McLaurin, and Ja'Marr Chase on 64.3-94.7% of their routes. Only McLaurin scored a touchdown with Surtain in tow, but none of those receivers surpassed 61 receiving yards with Surtain following them. Since Week 10, Doubs has had a 15.1% target share with 20.2 receiving yards per game with 0.96 yards per route run, and a 16% first-read share. In those five games, he has had four red zone targets and two deep targets. Since Week 8, Denver has utilized two high at the ninth-highest rate (57.1%). Since Week 10, against two high, Doubs has had a team-leading 18.8% target share with 1.73 yards per route run and a 17.1% first-read share. I lean that out of the two players, Watson is more likely to get the Surtain treatment this week. If I'm right, Doubs should see a bump in work. Since Week 8, Denver has allowed the sixth-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers while also holding them to the 14th-fewest PPR points per target.",

The lack of passing volume in this offense makes Gadsden a tough player to trust in any format. Since Week 11, Kansas City has had the third-highest two-high rate (62.2%). Since Week 6, against two high, Gadsden has ranked second on the team with a 17.8% target share with 2.08 yards per route run (leads the team) and a 20% first-read share. Gadsden is in the streaming/low-end TE1 area code this week, and that's probably a rosier outlook than he deserves, but the matchup is nice.

In Weeks 1-3, Evans was the clear leader of the passing attack with a 27.3% target share and 35.4% first-read share, churning out 46.7 receiving yards per game with 1.56 yards per route run. In those three games, Evans had five red zone targets and six deep targets. I expect him to see plenty of high cholesterol usage this week, even in a somewhat limited role.

In those seven games, he has had only two red zone targets and zero deep targets. Hockenson is only a desperation streaming option this week.

Bech had two red zone targets. He isn't a sexy flex option, but in deeper leagues, you could do a lot worse.
